# Bachelor-Thesis-Code

For my bachelor thesis, I analyzed the medical data of 70 individuals.
In particular, my task was to study the patterns in concentration measurements of 16 proteins, taken from 70 subjects that had undergone silicon implant surgery, and in accordance, to cluster the population of the sample.

For the determination of the clusters, an algorithm was designed and implemented in C/C++ programming language (Bachelor-Thesis-Code).
No prior classification scheme was given, and thus, for this unsupervised learning task, Euclidean distance was used as a metric to create the distance matrices and subsequently, to determine the groups of individuals.
The input dataset for the program was a 2-dimensional matrix, which contained the concentrations of 16 proteins, for each of the 70 subjects of the sample.
Although strictly anonymous, the dataset that was used for this project is not provided here for confidentiality reasons.

The results of this data analysis project were used to correlate the high or low concentrations of specific proteins in groups of individuals with the manifestation of the post-surgery pathological condition of fibrosis.
