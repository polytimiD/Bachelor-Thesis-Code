# Bachelor-Thesis-Code

For my bachelor thesis, I analyzed the medical data of 70 individuals.
In particular, my task was to study the patterns of 16 protein concentration measurements from individuals that had undergone silicon implant surgery, and group the 70 subjects of the sample accordingly.

The results of the thesis were used to correlate the high or low concentrations of specific proteins with the manifestation of the post-surgery pathological condition of fibrosis.
No prior classification scheme was given, and thus, for this unsupervised learning task, Euclidean distance was used as a metric to create the distance matrices and subsequently, to determine the groups of the individuals.

Although strictly anonymous, the data that were used for this data analysis project are not provided here for confidentiality reasons.
